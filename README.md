# Shehacks_Team-003

This is our submission for SheHack 2021 hackathon

## Game Rules
In this game the user has to select two cards at a time. </br>
If the next card you flip matches, a pop-up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your Tokens Collected.</br>
Also Metamask pop-up shows up and the non fungible coins are transferred to the Ethereum network.</br>
All the coins are collected and stored.</br>
These cards then disappear.</br>
If the token pairs do not match, a pop-up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back.</br>
The game continues until you have all the matching pairs of tiles.</br>
