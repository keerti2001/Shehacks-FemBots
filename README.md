## Match The Tiles
This is a Blockchain based memory game, where the user is supposed to find matching tiles. As soon as the user finds a match, the user gets to keep it forever of the Blockchain.</br>
Each tiles is represented by a blockchain token, which can be kept in wallet after getting matched. These tokens can be transfered outside of the game or keep them as collectables. </br>

## Game Rules
1. In this game the user has to select two cards at a time. </br>
2. If the next card you flip matches, a pop-up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your Tokens Collected.</br>
3. Also Metamask pop-up shows up and the non fungible coins are transferred to the Ethereum network.</br>
4. All the coins are collected and stored.</br>
5. These cards then disappear.</br>
6. If the token pairs do not match, a pop-up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back.</br>
7. The game continues until you have all the matching pairs of tiles.</br>
